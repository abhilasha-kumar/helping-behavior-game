      Welcome to Move-a-Block! 
      <br><br>
      You are the Architect in this game. You will play this game with a Helper who will try to help you attain different secret goals. 
      <br><br>
      The Helper will not know the goal that you are trying to achieve until it is complete. On each trial, you will be able to move a block 
      in order to achieve your secret goal. After you complete your turn, the Helper will have the option to either move a block or pass their turn. 
      Your task is to minimize the number of moves you make yourself and try to solve the goal with the Helper's assistance.
