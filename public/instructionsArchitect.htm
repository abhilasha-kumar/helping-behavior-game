      Welcome to Move-a-Block! This is a collaborative game with two players, the Architect and the Helper.
      <br><br>
      You are the Architect. You are playing this game with another Amazon Mechanical Turk worker, who is the Helper. The Helper will try to help you attain different secret goals. 
      <br><br>
      The Helper will not know the goal that you are trying to achieve until it is complete. On each trial, you will be able to move a block 
      in order to achieve your secret goal. Your task is to try to complete the assigned goal and split the work with the Helper as much as possible.
