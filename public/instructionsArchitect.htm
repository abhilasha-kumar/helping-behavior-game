      Welcome to Move-a-Block! This is a game with two players, the Architect and the Helper.
      <br><br>
      You are the Architect in this game. You are playing this game with another person (Helper) who will try to help you attain different secret goals. 
      <br><br>
      The Helper will not know the goal that you are trying to achieve until it is complete. On each trial, you will be able to move a block 
      in order to achieve your secret goal. After you complete your turn, the Helper will have the option to either move a block or pass their turn. 
      Your task is to try to complete the assigned goal and split the work with the Helper as much as possible.
