      Welcome to Help Town! 
      <br>
      You are the Architect in this game. You will play this game with a Helper who will try to help you attain a secret goal. 
      <br>
      Goals may be of different forms, but will include a color, shape, and room (e.g., moving all green circles to Room B).
      <br>
      While the Helper will not know the goal that you are trying to achieve, on each trial, the Helper will be able to either
      move a block, ask you a yes/no question, or pass your turn. Once their turn is complete,
      you will either get to move a block or answer the Helper's question. 
      <br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Continue”.
