      Welcome to Move-a-Block! This is a collaborative game with two players, the Architect and the Helper.
      <br><br>
      You are the Helper. You are playing this game with another Amazon Mechanical Turk worker, who is the Architect. The Architect is trying to attain different secret goals by aligning blocks on a grid. 
      <br><br>
      You will not know the goal that the Architect is trying to achieve until it is completed. On each trial, you will be able to either
      <strong>move a block</strong> or <strong>pass your turn</strong>. Your task is to help the Architect achieve their goal by sharing their work as much as possible.
