      Welcome to Move-a-Block! This is a game with two players, the Architect and the Helper.
      <br><br>
      You are the Helper in this game. You are playing this game with another person (the Architect) who is trying to align blocks on a grid to attain different secret goals. 
      <br><br>
      You will not know the goal that the Architect is trying to achieve until it is completed. On each trial, you will be able to either
      <strong>move a block</strong> or <strong>pass your turn</strong>. Your task is to help the Architect achieve their goal by sharing their work as much as possible.
