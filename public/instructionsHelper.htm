      Welcome to Move-a-Block! 
      <br><br>
      You are the Helper in this game. You will play this game with an Architect who is trying to align blocks on a grid to attain different secret goals. 
      <br><br>
      You will not know the goal that the Architect is trying to achieve until it is completed. On each trial, you will be able to either
      move a block or pass your turn. Your task is to help the Architect achieve their goal in the minimum number of moves.
