      Welcome to Help Town! 
      <br>
      <br>
      You are the Helper in this game. You will play this game with an Architect who is trying to align the blocks to attain a secret goal. 
      <br>
      Goals may be of different forms, but will include a color, shape, and room (e.g., moving all green circles to Room B).
      <br>
      While you will not know the goal that the Architect is trying to achieve, on each trial, you will be able to either
      move a block, ask the Architect a yes/no question, or pass your turn. 
      <br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Continue”.
